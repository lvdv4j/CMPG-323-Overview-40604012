# CMPG-323-Overview-40604012

## Project Description:

Welcome to my CMPG 323 Overview repository! This project is part of the CMPG 323 module and aims to set up a GitHub repository and a GitHub Kanban project to plan and track work effectively throughout the semester. The primary goal is to enhance project management skills using Agile principles and tools like Scrum and Kanban.

## Table of Contents:

- [Repositories for Each Project](#repositories-for-each-project)
- [Project and Repository Integration](#project-and-repository-integration)
- [Branching Strategy](#branching-strategy)
- [Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information](#storage-of-credentials-and-sensitive-information)
- [.gitignore Usage](#gitignore-usage)

## Repositories for Each Project:

A GitHub Repository (Henceforth referred to as a "github repo" or just "repo" for short) will be created for each project. Since there are 5 Projects, 5 repos will be created in total. You can find a map to all the Projects and the links to their repos below:

## Project and Repository Integration:

(Add content explaining how the project and repository are integrated)

## Branching Strategy:

(Add content explaining the branching strategy used within each project)

## Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information:

Credentials and sensitive information should not be accessible to other users and thus will not be stored on GitHub. Sensitive information might have to be encrypted to be further protected.*

***This is still to be decided**

## .gitignore Usage:
